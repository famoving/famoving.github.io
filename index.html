        <h3>Welcome To Family Affairs Movers</h3>
        <p>We are family owned and operated, servicing Columbia and surrounding areas since 2013. We value our customers and their property, which is why we strive to deliver excellent service at affordable prices. We <b>do not</b> provide trucks, but that is also one of the ways we keep our rates low. We will work tirelessly for you from beginning to end, not stopping until the last item is loaded and/or unloaded. We also offer:</p>
